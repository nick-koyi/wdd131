                    Kenya is located on the eastern coast of Africa 
                    and is bordered by the Indian Ocean to the southeast.
                     It is known for its diverse landscapes, 
                     including savannas, mountain highlands, and 
                     the Great Rift Valley. Kenya is famous for 
                     its wildlife and is home to some of the worldâ€™s 
                     most renowned national parks and reserves, where the 
                     "Big Five" animals (lion, leopard, elephant, buffalo,
                      and rhino) can be seen. Kenya is also known for its 
                      rich cultural heritage and the Maasai people, as well as
                      its coffee and tea exports.
